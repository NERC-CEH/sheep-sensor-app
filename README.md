# sheep-sensor-app
An app to show the risk of specific environmental events occurring in near real time using data from environmental sensors in the Conway Catchment.

Sensors measuring sheep movements, soil condition and weather have been deployed in the Conway Catchment.  This app demonstrates how they can be used to predict environmental events eg sheep manure pollution in a rainfall run-off event.
